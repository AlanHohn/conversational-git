This book was written because I thought there weren't enough books and webpages
about Git. No, not really.

This book was written because I saw an ever-so-narrow niche for a book that introduced Git
from the perspective of a person who uses it every day, but still remembers what it was
like getting up to speed. I remember having questions like:

* I see that there's extra complexity with Git because of the need to synchronize different
  repositories. What are the benefits that justify that extra step?
* What commands am I really going to use everyday? 
* Is branching really easy and cheap enough that I can use it for everything?
* What are the "go-to" commands for when I mess stuff up?
* How is team collaboration different with Git?

I'm trying to answer these questions on behalf of smart people that want to understand and evaluate
the tool *before* they put in the effort to get into its architecture and learn the more advanced
commands that even a regular user hardly needs.
